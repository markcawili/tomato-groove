# Tomato Groove

## Tomato Groove is a Pomodoro timer with Spotify Integration and a simple To-Do list application written with React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 

This project is an exercise of my learned React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript skills. The idea arose as I wanted a simple 
Pomodoro timer to study with and integration with Spotify to see what song is playing. I wanted it to be as minimal as 
possible and to include a to-do list for my current tasks. This application requires you to authenticate with Spotify
to allow for access to your playlists. No personal data or usage information is kept by the application. 

The timer runs for 25 minutes and includes 5-minute breaks. To start the timer, simply click on the countdown. To see 
and play your playlists, click the `Log In` button to authenticate with Spotify and click on the desired playlist. 

## Access

You can access this application through https://tomato-groove.web.app/ or https://tomato-groove.firebaseapp.com/ as it
is hosted on Google Firebase. 

To access this project locally, fork this repository and run the following commands...

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Known Issues

There may be bugs present when using smaller screen sizes "ie: on mobile devices". Currently, some extra ideas that I 
may implement include a button to switch between 'Liked songs' and 'Playlists' and perhaps an initial popup modal to 
show potential users any information about the application and how to use it.
